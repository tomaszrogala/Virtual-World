# Virtual-World
This is a project made to further develop my programming knowledge in c++
In this case i developed my object oriented programming skills.
I used the benefits of inheritance and polimorfism with even more various objects.
I realized: When we need often to remove an object in bigger data structures. 
Using the list structure is a much faster option then using a simple array.
